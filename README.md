# Wordpress Plugin Territory Development #

This is a Wordpress plugin territory experiment.

This plugin provides a support for creating default functionalities for a entire company wordpress environment.

All you need is the core component XP WP CORE.

After that, other plugins that expands the company ecosystem need to be based on XP WP CORE (see XP WP QUOTES).
